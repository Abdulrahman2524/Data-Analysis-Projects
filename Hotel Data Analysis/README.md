# Hotel Data Analysis Using Power BI

## Analyzed hotel revenue data (2018–2020) using SQL and Power BI to uncover key business insights.

## These are the questions that the analysis process was focused on:
1. Is our hotel revenue growing year over year? (segment revenue by hotel type)
2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
3. What trends can we see in the data?

### Total revenue: $29.1M, with City Hotels (48%) and Resort Hotels (52%).
### Parking demand ≈ 2.3% of bookings → guided parking capacity decisions.
### Identified seasonal peaks (mid-2019) to support demand forecasting.
